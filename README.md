An open-source AI agent with multi-agent orchestration, autonomous cognitive systems, and a full management dashboard. Runs locally, supports every major LLM provider, and ships with 44 built-in tools.

## What's New in 0.4.25

**Plan mode.** Captain Claw can now plan, execute, verify, and self-revise multi-step work end-to-end. A single user request becomes a reviewable DAG of executable steps, runs under the existing orchestrator, and gates each step through per-step acceptance criteria — with bounded auto-revision when verification fails. Plan mode is wired through Flight Deck's chat as a first-class peer to free-form chat.

- **`/plan <request>`** — `PlanGenerator` produces a 3-8 step plan with concrete `description` + measurable `acceptance_criteria` for every step. Persisted as a workflow JSON in `workspace/workflows/`, so it round-trips with the existing workflow tools. Deliverable steps are now required to name their output file (e.g. `saved/tmp/<slug>.md`) so the artefact never gets buried in the run transcript.
- **`/plan-execute`** — `PlanExecutor` runs the plan through the DAG runner, emits live `plan_*` events, and short-circuits the orchestrator's redundant final synthesis pass (`skip_synthesize=True`) — the plan card itself is the deliverable surface.
- **Two-stage verification gate** — `PlanVerifier` runs optional JSON-schema validation first (fast, deterministic), then an LLM judge against `acceptance_criteria`. Failures stop the walk and surface the verifier's notes in the plan card.
- **Bounded auto-revision** — `PlanReviser` rewrites the failing step's description (and optionally tightens its acceptance criteria), and `PlanExecutor` resets the failed step + transitive dependents to PENDING before re-running. Default budget: 2 revisions per step.
- **Orchestrate-kind fan-out** — `step_kind: "orchestrate"` steps are expanded in place via `SessionOrchestrator._decompose`. Sub-tasks run in parallel; the original step becomes an atomic join with the sub-task IDs as deps.
- **Inline plan card in chat** — Live per-step status, verification chips, revision badges with rationale popovers, collapsible long plans, **persisted to `localStorage`** so a Flight Deck refresh mid-plan repaints the card identically.
- **`/planning on` toggle** — A bold violet `ON`/`OFF` pill in the chat composer. With it on, every plain-text message you send is auto-routed through `/plan` + `/plan-execute` — no slash commands needed. The pill mirrors the agent's authoritative state both ways and pulses while a plan runs.
- **Connection resilience** — WebSocket plumbing hardened end-to-end for the long executor + verifier + reviser cycles: agent ⇄ FD `ping_interval=20` keepalive, browser auto-reconnect with exponential backoff, server-side `_send` and receive loop wrapped against `ClientConnectionResetError` so a refresh mid-step doesn't fill the agent log with tracebacks.
- **Research-aware iteration budget** — `_estimate_task_iterations` learned the shape of multi-source research steps (`reputable sources`, `at least N sources`, `web_search`, `each source` patterns); ceiling raised from 25 → 40 so `gather_sources` stops exhausting its budget mid-research.
- **Workflow run transcripts viewable** — `workspace/workflows/` is now in the file-preview allow-list, so the Markdown transcripts auto-saved by `_save_run_output` open from the chat without 403.

Backward compatible — existing 0.4.24 configurations keep working unchanged and plan mode stays opt-in even when the toggle is off. See `RELEASE_NOTES_0.4.25.md` for the full per-step breakdown.

## What Makes Captain Claw Different

### Flight Deck — Multi-Agent Command Center

A full management dashboard for running teams of AI agents. Spawn, monitor, configure, and coordinate agents from a single UI.

```bash
captain-claw-fd    # http://0.0.0.0:25080
```

- **Agent Forge** — Describe a business goal in plain text. An LLM designs a specialized team with roles, tools, operating procedures, and a lead coordinator. Review, customize, and spawn the entire team in one click.
- **Agent Council** — Structured multi-agent deliberation. Run brainstorms, debates, reviews, or planning sessions with 2-N agents. Each agent self-scores suitability, chooses actions (answer, challenge, refine, broaden), and responds in moderated rounds. A moderator synthesizes conclusions; all agents vote. Export as markdown minutes.
- **Fleet Communication** — Agents discover peers automatically. Consult (synchronous ask) or delegate (asynchronous queue) tasks to specialist agents. Shared workspace and file transfer across the fleet.
- **Director Panel** — Unified overview of all agents. Broadcast messages fleet-wide. Per-agent token/cost analytics, trace timelines, datastore browser, file browser, config editor.
- **Multi-user Auth** — JWT authentication, admin dashboard, rate limiting, and quotas.
- **MCP Connections** — Add Model Context Protocol servers (HTTP or stdio) once and every entitled agent in the fleet picks up their tools — no per-agent config. Phase 2 adds stdio transport for `npx`/`uvx`-shipped servers, per-agent allowlists, hot tool-list reload over SSE, and streaming tool calls.

### Cognitive Architecture

Captain Claw has a five-layer memory system and autonomous cognitive processes that run without user intervention.

**Memory Layers:**

| Layer | What it stores | How it's used |
|---|---|---|
| Working Memory | Current conversation in the LLM context window | Immediate reasoning |
| Semantic Memory | Hybrid vector + BM25 full-text search over documents and sessions | Auto-injected when relevant to the current query |
| Deep Memory | Typesense-backed long-term archive, scales to millions of documents | Searched on demand for deep recall |
| Insights | Auto-extracted facts, contacts, decisions, and deadlines (SQLite + FTS5) | Cross-session knowledge injected into system prompt |
| Nervous System | Autonomous "intuitions" — patterns, hypotheses, and connections | Surfaces non-obvious findings the agent wouldn't otherwise notice |

**Autonomous Processes:**

- **Dreaming** — Background dream cycles cross-reference all memory layers to synthesize intuitions. Runs after every N messages and during idle hours. Intuitions have confidence scores that decay over time unless validated.
- **Tension Tracking** — Holds unresolved contradictions (like musical dissonance) rather than forcing premature resolution. Tensions persist until evidence resolves them.
- **Maturation Pipeline** — New intuitions sit through multiple dream cycles before being surfaced to the agent, reducing noise.
- **Cognitive Tempo** — Detects whether the user is in deep contemplative mode or rapid task execution, and adapts processing depth accordingly (adagio / moderato / allegro).
- **Cognitive Modes** — Seven tunable behavioral profiles (Ionian through Locrian, inspired by musical scales) that shift the agent between analytical, creative, cautious, and exploratory approaches.
- **Self-Reflection** — Periodic self-assessment that reviews conversations, memory, and completed tasks to generate improvement directives injected into the system prompt.
- **Insights Extraction** — Automatically identifies durable knowledge from conversations — deduplicates, categorizes, and stores for future context injection.

**Visualization:**

- **Brain Graph** — Interactive 3D force-directed graph of the entire cognitive topology. Insights, intuitions, tasks, contacts, and sessions rendered as typed nodes with provenance edges. Live WebSocket updates.
- **Process of Thoughts** — Full lineage tracking across all cognitive subsystems. Every message, insight, intuition, and task is connected via provenance IDs, forming a traversable thought graph.

### Orchestrator / DAG Mode

Decompose complex tasks into a dependency graph and execute subtasks in parallel across separate agent sessions.

```
/orchestrate Research startups in 3 countries, analyze founders, create comparison spreadsheet
```

- LLM decomposes the prompt into a task DAG with dependencies
- Parallel execution with configurable worker count
- Shared workspace for inter-task data flow
- Structured output validation (JSON Schema with auto-retry)
- Real-time trace timeline (Gantt-style visualization)
- Headless CLI mode for cron/scripts: `captain-claw-orchestrate`

### BotPort — Agent-to-Agent Network

Connect multiple Captain Claw instances through a routing hub. Agents delegate tasks to specialists based on expertise tags, persona matching, or LLM-powered routing.

- **BotPort Swarm** — DAG-based multi-agent orchestration across networked instances. Approval gates, retry with fallback, checkpointing, inter-agent file transfer (up to 50 MB), cron scheduling, and a visual dashboard.

### MCP Server (act as an MCP server)

Captain Claw runs as a Model Context Protocol server over stdio — Claude Desktop and other MCP clients can browse sessions, read conversation history, and send prompts to the full agent.

```bash
captain-claw-mcp    # stdio, configure in claude_desktop_config.json
```

### MCP Client (consume MCP servers via Flight Deck)

The other direction: agents in your fleet call into MCP servers. Add a server once in **Flight Deck → Connections → MCP servers** and every agent the allowlist permits gets the tools auto-registered on boot.

- **HTTP transport** — Streamable-HTTP MCP servers, with optional OAuth2 `client_credentials`, captured `Mcp-Session-Id`, and SSE-response parsing.
- **stdio transport** — `command` + `args` + `env` for local MCP servers shipped via `npx` / `uvx` (filesystem, sqlite, github, postgres, etc.). Children are spawned lazily, auto-respawned on death, and torn down with SIGTERM/SIGKILL on close.
- **Per-agent allowlists** — Restrict each server to specific agent slugs. Disallowed agents get HTTP 404 (existence is opaque).
- **Hot reload** — Agents subscribe to `/fd/mcp/agent/events` (SSE) and re-register proxy tools the moment you change a server — no restart needed.
- **Streaming calls** — `POST /fd/mcp/<name>/call_stream` emits `progress` / `result` / `error` SSE frames for UIs that want live indicators while a long-running tool runs.

See **USAGE.md → Flight Deck → Connections → MCP servers** for the full endpoint reference and config schema.

### Safety Guards

Three layers of protection that run before, during, and after agent operations:

- **Input guards** — Validate user intent before the LLM sees it
- **Script guards** — AST-level analysis of generated code before execution
- **Output guards** — Validate tool results for hallucinations and safety

Guards support two modes: `stop_suspicious` (block automatically) or `ask_for_approval` (prompt the user).
