An open-source AI agent with multi-agent orchestration, autonomous cognitive systems, and a full management dashboard. Runs locally, supports every major LLM provider, and ships with 44 built-in tools.

## What Makes Captain Claw Different

### Flight Deck — Multi-Agent Command Center

A full management dashboard for running teams of AI agents. Spawn, monitor, configure, and coordinate agents from a single UI.

```bash
captain-claw-fd    # http://0.0.0.0:25080
```

- **Agent Forge** — Describe a business goal in plain text. An LLM designs a specialized team with roles, tools, operating procedures, and a lead coordinator. Review, customize, and spawn the entire team in one click.
- **Agent Council** — Structured multi-agent deliberation. Run brainstorms, debates, reviews, or planning sessions with 2-N agents. Each agent self-scores suitability, chooses actions (answer, challenge, refine, broaden), and responds in moderated rounds. A moderator synthesizes conclusions; all agents vote. Export as markdown minutes.
- **Fleet Communication** — Agents discover peers automatically. Consult (synchronous ask) or delegate (asynchronous queue) tasks to specialist agents. Shared workspace and file transfer across the fleet.
- **Director Panel** — Unified overview of all agents. Broadcast messages fleet-wide. Per-agent token/cost analytics, trace timelines, datastore browser, file browser, config editor.
- **Multi-user Auth** — JWT authentication, admin dashboard, rate limiting, and quotas.

### Cognitive Architecture

Captain Claw has a five-layer memory system and autonomous cognitive processes that run without user intervention.

**Memory Layers:**

| Layer | What it stores | How it's used |
|---|---|---|
| Working Memory | Current conversation in the LLM context window | Immediate reasoning |
| Semantic Memory | Hybrid vector + BM25 full-text search over documents and sessions | Auto-injected when relevant to the current query |
| Deep Memory | Typesense-backed long-term archive, scales to millions of documents | Searched on demand for deep recall |
| Insights | Auto-extracted facts, contacts, decisions, and deadlines (SQLite + FTS5) | Cross-session knowledge injected into system prompt |
| Nervous System | Autonomous "intuitions" — patterns, hypotheses, and connections | Surfaces non-obvious findings the agent wouldn't otherwise notice |

**Autonomous Processes:**

- **Dreaming** — Background dream cycles cross-reference all memory layers to synthesize intuitions. Runs after every N messages and during idle hours. Intuitions have confidence scores that decay over time unless validated.
- **Tension Tracking** — Holds unresolved contradictions (like musical dissonance) rather than forcing premature resolution. Tensions persist until evidence resolves them.
- **Maturation Pipeline** — New intuitions sit through multiple dream cycles before being surfaced to the agent, reducing noise.
- **Cognitive Tempo** — Detects whether the user is in deep contemplative mode or rapid task execution, and adapts processing depth accordingly (adagio / moderato / allegro).
- **Cognitive Modes** — Seven tunable behavioral profiles (Ionian through Locrian, inspired by musical scales) that shift the agent between analytical, creative, cautious, and exploratory approaches.
- **Self-Reflection** — Periodic self-assessment that reviews conversations, memory, and completed tasks to generate improvement directives injected into the system prompt.
- **Insights Extraction** — Automatically identifies durable knowledge from conversations — deduplicates, categorizes, and stores for future context injection.

**Visualization:**

- **Brain Graph** — Interactive 3D force-directed graph of the entire cognitive topology. Insights, intuitions, tasks, contacts, and sessions rendered as typed nodes with provenance edges. Live WebSocket updates.
- **Process of Thoughts** — Full lineage tracking across all cognitive subsystems. Every message, insight, intuition, and task is connected via provenance IDs, forming a traversable thought graph.

### Orchestrator / DAG Mode

Decompose complex tasks into a dependency graph and execute subtasks in parallel across separate agent sessions.

```
/orchestrate Research startups in 3 countries, analyze founders, create comparison spreadsheet
```

- LLM decomposes the prompt into a task DAG with dependencies
- Parallel execution with configurable worker count
- Shared workspace for inter-task data flow
- Structured output validation (JSON Schema with auto-retry)
- Real-time trace timeline (Gantt-style visualization)
- Headless CLI mode for cron/scripts: `captain-claw-orchestrate`

### BotPort — Agent-to-Agent Network

Connect multiple Captain Claw instances through a routing hub. Agents delegate tasks to specialists based on expertise tags, persona matching, or LLM-powered routing.

- **BotPort Swarm** — DAG-based multi-agent orchestration across networked instances. Approval gates, retry with fallback, checkpointing, inter-agent file transfer (up to 50 MB), cron scheduling, and a visual dashboard.

### MCP Server

Captain Claw runs as a Model Context Protocol server over stdio — Claude Desktop and other MCP clients can browse sessions, read conversation history, and send prompts to the full agent.

```bash
captain-claw-mcp    # stdio, configure in claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Safety Guards

Three layers of protection that run before, during, and after agent operations:

- **Input guards** — Validate user intent before the LLM sees it
- **Script guards** — AST-level analysis of generated code before execution
- **Output guards** — Validate tool results for hallucinations and safety

Guards support two modes: `stop_suspicious` (block automatically) or `ask_for_approval` (prompt the user).

## Multi-Model Support

Mix providers freely — each session independently selects its model.

| Provider | Models |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4-mini, GPT-5.4-nano, o3, o4-mini, gpt-image-1.5 |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 (with prompt caching) |
| Google | Gemini 3.1 Pro/Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash |
| Ollama | Any local model |
| OpenRouter | 200+ models via meta-router |

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install captain-claw
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.
captain-claw-web                         # http://127.0.0.1:23080
```

```bash
captain-claw-web          # Web UI (default)
captain-claw              # Interactive terminal
captain-claw --tui        # Terminal UI
captain-claw-fd           # Flight Deck multi-agent dashboard
captain-claw-mcp          # MCP server for Claude Desktop
botport                   # Agent-to-agent routing hub
```

First run starts onboarding automatically. For Ollama, no key needed — set `provider: ollama` in `config.yaml`.

## Configuration

YAML-driven with environment variable overrides (`CLAW_` prefix).

```yaml
model:
  provider: gemini
  model: gemini-2.5-flash
  allowed:
    - id: claude-sonnet
      provider: anthropic
      model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    - id: gpt-4o
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4o

web:
  enabled: true
  port: 23080
```

**Load precedence:** `./config.yaml` > `~/.captain-claw/config.yaml` > env vars > `.env` > defaults.
