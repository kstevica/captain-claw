Here's what I found from fetching www.hr:

**Summary:**
The website appears to be a minimal "coming soon" page for **dot.hr** (a Croatian portal). The content is very brief and largely repetitive:

- **Main message:** "dot.hr – Spajamo točke na novi način" (Croatian for "Connecting dots in a new way")
- **Additional text:** "dot portal • uskoro online" (meaning "coming soon")
- **Interactive element:** "Pritisni R za replay" (Press R for replay)

The page is essentially a placeholder with minimal content — likely a pre-launch landing page.

**File status:** No file has been saved yet. If you'd like me to save this summary to **wwwhr-new.txt**, let me know and I'll create it for you.
