## Summary of www.hr

The website appears to be a minimal landing page for **dot.hr** (the Croatian country code top-level domain). Here's what was found:

- **Main heading:** "dot.hr – Spajamo točke na novi način" (Croatian for "Connecting dots in a new way")
- **Status:** "dot portal • uskoro online" (meaning "coming soon online")
- **Interactive element:** "Pritisni R za replay" ("Press R for replay")

The page is essentially a "coming soon" or under-construction page for a Croatian domain portal.
